    <h1>People Power Anniversary</h1>
    <h2>February 25, 2025</h2>

    <p>The <strong>People Power Anniversary</strong>, celebrated every <strong>February 25</strong>, marks one of the most significant moments in Philippine historyâ€”the <strong>EDSA People Power Revolution</strong> of 1986. This peaceful uprising led to the ousting of then-President <strong>Ferdinand Marcos</strong> and the restoration of democracy in the country. Millions of Filipinos, including civilians, religious leaders, and military personnel, gathered along <strong>EDSA (Epifanio de los Santos Avenue)</strong> in Metro Manila to protest against dictatorship and advocate for freedom and justice.</p>

    <p>The commemoration of <strong>People Power Anniversary</strong> is a reminder of the Filipinos' unity and resilience in fighting for democracy. Every year, various activities take place, such as <strong>wreath-laying ceremonies, exhibits, and educational programs</strong> to honor the courage of those who participated in the revolution. In Metro Manila, a portion of <strong>EDSA</strong> is often closed for official programs, where government officials and organizations reflect on the importance of upholding democracy and human rights.</p>

    <p>Beyond official ceremonies, the <strong>People Power Revolution</strong> remains an inspiration for future generations. It symbolizes the power of peaceful protests and collective action in bringing about political change. While opinions on its impact vary, the event continues to be a defining moment in Philippine history, reminding Filipinos of their role in preserving democracy and national unity.</p>
