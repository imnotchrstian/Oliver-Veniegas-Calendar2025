    <h1>Feast of the Immaculate Conception</h1>
    <h2>December 8, 2025</h2>

    <p>The <strong>Feast of the Immaculate Conception</strong>, celebrated every <strong>December 8</strong>, is a significant religious holiday in the Philippines. It honors the Catholic belief that the Virgin Mary was conceived without original sin, making her pure and worthy to be the mother of Jesus Christ. As the country with the largest Catholic population in Asia, the Philippines observes this day with great devotion and reverence.</p>

    <p>Churches across the country hold special <strong>Masses, processions, and prayers</strong> dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Many Filipinos visit Marian shrines and churches, such as the <strong>Manila Cathedral</strong> and the <strong>National Shrine of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception</strong>, to offer flowers and candles as signs of their faith. Schools and religious institutions also organize activities to deepen the understanding of Mary's role in the Catholic faith.</p>

    <p>Declared a special non-working holiday in the Philippines, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception allows the faithful to take part in religious activities and reflect on Mary's life of humility and obedience. The celebration serves as a reminder of her purity and unwavering faith, inspiring Filipinos to seek her guidance and protection in their daily lives.</p>
