    <h1>New Year's Eve</h1>
    <h2>December 31, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>New Year's Eve</strong> in the Philippines is a vibrant and festive occasion, celebrated with loud and colorful traditions. Families and friends gather for <strong>Media Noche</strong>, a grand midnight feast believed to bring prosperity and good luck for the coming year. Tables are filled with dishes like pancit for long life, sticky rice for strong family ties, and round fruits symbolizing wealth.</p>

    <p>Filipinos welcome the new year with <strong>fireworks, torotot (horns), and loud noises</strong> to drive away evil spirits and bad luck. Many wear <strong>polka-dotted clothes</strong> and keep coins in their pockets, hoping to attract financial prosperity. Children jump at midnight, believing it will make them taller, while families open doors and windows to let in good fortune.</p>

    <p>Aside from the festivities, New Year's Eve is also a time for reflection and setting resolutions. Some families attend church services to offer prayers for a blessed year ahead. The combination of tradition, faith, and joy makes New Year's Eve in the Philippines a unique and memorable celebration.</p>
