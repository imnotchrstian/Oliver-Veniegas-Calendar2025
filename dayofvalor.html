    <h1>Day of Valor</h1>
    <h2>April 9, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Day of Valor</strong> or <strong>Araw ng Kagitingan</strong>, observed every April 9th, is a significant public holiday in the Philippines that honors the bravery, heroism, and sacrifices made by Filipino and American soldiers during World War II. The holiday commemorates the Fall of Bataan in 1942, a pivotal moment when Filipino and American forces, after months of fierce resistance, were forced to surrender to the invading Japanese forces. This event marked the beginning of the infamous <strong>Bataan Death March</strong>, where thousands of soldiers endured inhumane conditions, leading to countless deaths.</p>

    <p>On this day, Filipinos remember the sacrifices of the soldiers who fought to defend the country against foreign occupation. Ceremonies, including wreath-laying events and military parades, are held in various parts of the country, particularly in Bataan, the site of the major battle. The <strong>Mount Samat National Shrine</strong>, located in Pilar, Bataan, serves as the focal point for the national commemoration, where leaders and veterans gather to pay tribute to the fallen heroes.</p>

    <p><strong>Day of Valor</strong> is not only a reminder of the courage of those who fought during World War II but also a time for Filipinos to reflect on the importance of freedom, peace, and unity. It is a day to honor those who gave their lives for the countryâ€™s sovereignty, and it serves as a symbol of national pride and patriotism.</p>
