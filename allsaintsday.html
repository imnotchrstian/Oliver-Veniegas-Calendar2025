    <h1>All Saints' Day</h1>
    <h2>November 1, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>All Saints' Day</strong>, or <strong>Undas</strong> in the Philippines, is observed on <strong>November 1</strong> as a day of remembrance for deceased loved ones and honored saints. It is a significant religious and cultural event, deeply rooted in Filipino tradition. Families gather to visit cemeteries, clean and decorate the graves of their ancestors with candles, flowers, and offerings. Many also hold prayers and spend the day reflecting on the lives of those who have passed.</p>

    <p>Filipinos often prepare special meals, including traditional delicacies like <strong>pansit</strong> (noodles for long life), <strong>kakanin</strong> (rice cakes), and <strong>candied fruits</strong>, which are shared with family and visitors. It is common for relatives to stay overnight at cemeteries, lighting candles and offering prayers for the souls of the departed. The event is both solemn and festive, as families use the time to reconnect and bond while honoring their ancestors.</p>

    <p>All Saints' Day in the Philippines is not just about mourning but also about celebrating the memory of those who came before. It is a tradition that strengthens family ties and reinforces the importance of faith, remembrance, and gratitude for life. The following day, <strong>All Souls' Day</strong> (November 2), is also observed as an extension of the commemoration.</p>
