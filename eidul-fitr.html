    <h1>Eidul-Fitr</h1>
    <h2>March 31, 2025 (Likely evening)</h2>

    <p><strong>Eid al-Fitr</strong>, known as <strong>Eidul-Fitr</strong>, is one of the most important religious holidays for Filipino Muslims, marking the end of <strong>Ramadan</strong>â€”a month-long period of fasting, prayer, and reflection. In the Philippines, the celebration is a festive occasion that brings together families and communities to rejoice in the successful completion of the fast and to give thanks to Allah for strength and guidance. The day is filled with prayers, feasts, and charitable acts as Muslims come together to celebrate and share their blessings.</p>

    <p>The celebration of <strong>Eidul-Fitr</strong> begins with a special prayer known as <strong>Salat al-Eid</strong>, which takes place early in the morning at mosques and open fields. Filipino Muslims wear their best clothes, often traditional attire such as the <strong>Barong Tagalog</strong> for men and colorful dresses for women, as a symbol of respect and unity. After the prayers, families visit one another, exchange gifts, and enjoy a variety of delicious dishes, many of which are specially prepared for the occasion, such as <strong>lumpia</strong> (spring rolls), <strong>kebabs</strong>, and sweet treats like <strong>kurd</strong> (a dessert made of coconut and sugar).</p>

    <p>One of the most important aspects of <strong>Eidul-Fitr</strong> is the practice of <strong>Zakat al-Fitr</strong>, a form of charity given to the less fortunate. This ensures that everyone can participate in the celebrations, even those who may be struggling financially. The holiday also encourages the values of forgiveness, unity, and gratitude, reminding the Muslim community in the Philippines of the importance of kindness, compassion, and family bonds. In some areas, especially in <strong>Mindanao</strong>, where there is a significant Muslim population, <strong>Eidul-Fitr</strong> is celebrated with large public gatherings, parades, and community events.</p>
