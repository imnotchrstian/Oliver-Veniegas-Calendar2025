    <h1>Christmas Day</h1>
    <h2>December 25, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Christmas Day</strong>, celebrated on <strong>December 25</strong>, is the most anticipated and joyous holiday in the Philippines. As a predominantly Catholic country, Filipinos embrace the holiday with deep religious and cultural significance. The celebration begins as early as September, known as the start of the “<strong>Ber Months</strong>,” when homes, malls, and streets light up with festive decorations, Christmas trees, and the iconic Filipino <strong>parol</strong> (Christmas lanterns).</p>

    <p>A key tradition during Christmas in the Philippines is attending the <strong>Misa de Gallo</strong> or <strong>Simbang Gabi</strong>, a series of nine dawn Masses leading up to Christmas Eve. On the night of December 24, families gather for <strong>Noche Buena</strong>, a grand midnight feast featuring dishes like <strong>lechon</strong> (roast pig), ham, queso de bola (cheese ball), and bibingka (rice cake). It is a time for family reunions, exchanging gifts, and spreading love and joy.</p>

    <p>Christmas in the Philippines is more than just a day—it is a season of sharing, faith, and togetherness. Filipinos celebrate the holiday with caroling, parties, and charitable activities, embodying the true spirit of Christmas. The warmth and festivity make it a special time of the year, as families and communities come together to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.</p>
