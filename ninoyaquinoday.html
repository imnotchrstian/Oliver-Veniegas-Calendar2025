    <h1>Ninoy Aquino Day</h1>
    <h2>August 21, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Ninoy Aquino Day</strong> is observed every <strong>August 21</strong> to commemorate the life and sacrifice of Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., one of the Philippines' most influential political figures. Aquino was an outspoken critic of the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos, and his assassination in 1983 upon returning from exile sparked widespread public outrage and became a turning point in the Philippine fight for democracy.</p>

    <p>The day is marked by remembrance and reflection on Ninoy Aquino’s contribution to the restoration of democracy in the Philippines. Events such as memorial services, speeches, and visits to the <strong>Ninoy Aquino Monument</strong> in Quezon City are held across the country. People also remember the courage and sacrifices of Aquino’s family, particularly his wife, former President <strong>Cory Aquino</strong>, and their role in leading the People Power Revolution in 1986 that ousted Marcos.</p>

    <p>Ninoy Aquino Day serves as a reminder of the importance of democracy, freedom, and the power of the people to create change. It is a day to honor the legacy of a man who gave his life for the hope of a better and more just society for the Filipino people.</p>
