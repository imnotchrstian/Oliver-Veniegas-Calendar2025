    <h1>New Year Day</h1>
    <h2>January 1, 2025</h2>
    
    <p>New Year's Day in the Philippines, celebrated on January 1, is a time of joy and festivity. It is a public holiday marked by family gatherings, traditions, and celebrations that reflect the country's rich culture and beliefs. The anticipation begins on New Year's Eve, as families prepare for <strong>Media Noche</strong>, a grand midnight feast featuring lucky foods such as round fruits, sticky rice, and various delicacies believed to bring prosperity.</p>
    <p>As the clock strikes midnight, Filipinos welcome the new year with <strong>fireworks, torotot (horns), and loud noises</strong> to drive away evil spirits and bad luck. Many follow customs like wearing <strong>polka-dotted clothes and keeping coins</strong> in their pockets to attract wealth. Children often <strong>jump at midnight</strong>, believing it will help them grow taller, while others open doors and windows to let good fortune in.</p>
    <p>New Year's Day itself is usually a time for rest and reflection after the night's celebrations. Many families visit relatives, enjoy leftovers from <strong>Media Noche</strong>, or attend church services to pray for a blessed and prosperous year ahead. The day is a fresh start, filled with hope and positivity as Filipinos look forward to new opportunities and happiness in the coming year.</p>
