    <h1>Eid al-Adha</h1>
    <h2>June 6, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Eid al-Adha</strong>, also known as the <strong>Festival of Sacrifice</strong>, is a significant Muslim holiday observed by the Muslim community in the Philippines. The date varies each year, but in 2025, it will be celebrated on <strong>June 6</strong>. Eid al-Adha commemorates the willingness of <strong>Ibrahim (Abraham)</strong> to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God's command, symbolizing faith and devotion.</p>

    <p>In the Philippines, Eid al-Adha is a public holiday, especially for the country's Muslim population. The day is marked by prayers at mosques, feasts, and the act of sacrifice, where Muslims slaughter livestock such as goats, cows, or sheep. The meat is distributed among family, friends, and the less fortunate, symbolizing charity and solidarity with those in need.</p>

    <p>Eid al-Adha in the Philippines is a day of reflection, unity, and gratitude. The Muslim community comes together to celebrate faith, sacrifice, and generosity, while also fostering a spirit of harmony and understanding with other communities.</p>
