    <h1>Rizal Day</h1>
    <h2>December 30, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Rizal Day</strong> is observed in the Philippines every <strong>December 30</strong> to honor the life and heroism of <strong>Dr. José Rizal</strong>, the country's national hero. This public holiday commemorates his execution by Spanish authorities in 1896 at <strong>Bagumbayan</strong> (now Luneta Park in Manila), which became a turning point in the fight for Philippine independence.</p>

    <p>The highlight of Rizal Day is the official <strong>ceremony at Rizal Park</strong>, where government officials, including the President, lead a wreath-laying ceremony at the <strong>Rizal Monument</strong>. Similar tributes and flag-raising ceremonies take place across the country, especially in places with historical ties to Rizal, such as his hometown of <strong>Calamba, Laguna</strong>.</p>

    <p>Beyond the official observances, Rizal Day serves as a time for Filipinos to reflect on Rizal’s ideals of nationalism, education, and reform. Schools, organizations, and historians hold discussions and activities to remember his contributions. His works, particularly "<strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong>" and "<strong>El Filibusterismo</strong>," continue to inspire Filipinos in their pursuit of freedom, justice, and progress.</p>
