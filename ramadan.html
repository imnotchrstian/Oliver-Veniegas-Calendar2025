    <h1>Ramadan</h1>
    <h2>March 1, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Ramadan</strong> is the holiest month of the Islamic calendar and is deeply observed by Muslims across the Philippines. The month is marked by fasting, prayer, reflection, and community service. Muslims refrain from eating or drinking from dawn until dusk, in observance of the spiritual discipline of fasting, one of the Five Pillars of Islam. This practice is intended to bring the faithful closer to Allah and to develop self-control and empathy for the less fortunate.</p>

    <p>In the Philippines, where a significant number of people are Muslim, Ramadan is a time for prayer, family gatherings, and charity. Muslims often attend special evening prayers known as <strong>Taraweeh</strong>, which are held at mosques throughout the month. During Ramadan, mosques are also filled with worshippers seeking spiritual enlightenment and offering prayers for peace and prosperity for the nation and the world.</p>

    <p>At the end of Ramadan, Muslims in the Philippines celebrate <strong>Eid al-Fitr</strong>, the festival of breaking the fast. It is a joyous occasion marked by family reunions, feasts, and the exchange of gifts. Muslims also give a special form of charity called <strong>Zakat al-Fitr</strong>, which helps provide food and assistance to the less fortunate. The celebration is not only a time of joy but also a time for reflection, gratitude, and acts of kindness.</p>
