    <h1>Bonifacio Day</h1>
    <h2>November 30, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Bonifacio Day</strong> is a national holiday in the Philippines celebrated every <strong>November 30</strong> to honor the birth of <strong>Andr√©s Bonifacio</strong>, a revolutionary leader known as the "Father of the Philippine Revolution." He was the founder of the <strong>Katipunan</strong>, a secret society that fought for the country's independence from Spanish rule.</p>

    <p>The day is marked by <strong>wreath-laying ceremonies</strong> and tributes at Bonifacio monuments across the country, especially in <strong>Caloocan City</strong>, where the Katipunan was first established. Schools and institutions also organize programs highlighting his bravery, leadership, and contribution to Philippine history.</p>

    <p>Bonifacio Day serves as a reminder of the Filipino people's resilience and struggle for freedom. It is a time for reflection on the values of patriotism, unity, and courage, which Bonifacio embodied in his fight for independence.</p>
