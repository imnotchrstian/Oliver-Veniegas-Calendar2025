    <h1>Valentine's Day</h1>
    <h2>February 14, 2025</h2>

    <p>Valentine’s Day in the Philippines is a widely celebrated occasion, filled with love, romance, and heartfelt gestures. Every February 14, couples exchange gifts such as chocolates, flowers, and stuffed toys as tokens of affection, while restaurants, parks, and malls are filled with people enjoying romantic dates. The holiday is not just for couples—friends, families, and even colleagues also take part by sharing sweet messages and small gifts, making the celebration inclusive and full of warmth.</p>

    <p>A unique Filipino tradition during Valentine's Day is the <strong>"mass wedding"</strong> events organized in different cities, where hundreds of couples tie the knot in a grand ceremony. These community weddings are often sponsored by local governments, allowing couples to celebrate their love without the financial burden of a costly wedding. Meanwhile, businesses take advantage of the occasion, with hotels, restaurants, and flower shops offering special promotions, making the day even more festive.</p>

    <p>Beyond the commercial aspect, Valentine’s Day in the Philippines is a time to express love not only to romantic partners but also to family and friends. Many Filipinos take the opportunity to show appreciation and gratitude to loved ones, reinforcing the country’s deeply rooted culture of affection and strong personal connections.</p>
