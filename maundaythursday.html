    <h1>Maundy Thursday</h1>
    <h2>April 17, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Maundy Thursday</strong>, known as <strong>Huwebes Santo</strong> in Filipino, is an important day in the observance of <strong>Holy Week</strong> in the Philippines. It is a public holiday and marks the beginning of the Easter Triduum, commemorating the last supper of Jesus Christ with His disciples. This day is observed by Filipino Catholics with solemnity and reverence, as it reflects Jesus’ acts of love, humility, and service. The day is named "Maundy" from the Latin word <em>mandatum</em>, meaning "command," referring to Jesus' commandment to love one another.</p>

    <p>On Maundy Thursday, churches in the Philippines are often filled with devout attendees who participate in religious services such as the <strong>“Washing of the Feet”</strong> ritual, where the priest reenacts Jesus washing the feet of His disciples as an act of humility. This day also marks the <strong>Last Supper Mass</strong>, where the faithful reflect on the institution of the Eucharist. The evening is also marked by the <strong>Visita Iglesia</strong>, a tradition where people visit at least seven churches to pray, seeking spiritual renewal and repentance.</p>

    <p><strong>Maundy Thursday</strong>, along with Good Friday, is a time of reflection and devotion for many Filipinos. It is a day dedicated to solemn prayers, fasting, and penance, allowing Filipinos to deepen their faith and remember the immense sacrifice made by Jesus Christ for humanity’s salvation.</p>
