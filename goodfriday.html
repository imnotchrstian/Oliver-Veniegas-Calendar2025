    <h1>Good Friday</h1>
    <h2>April 18, 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Good Friday</strong>, known as <strong>Biernes Santo</strong> in Filipino, is one of the most solemn days in the Christian calendar, particularly in the Philippines, where it is observed with deep reverence. It commemorates the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ, marking His ultimate sacrifice for the salvation of humanity. The day is a public holiday in the Philippines, and it is a time for reflection, prayer, and penance.</p>

    <p>Filipinos observe Good Friday with various religious practices, including <strong>Visita Iglesia</strong>, where devotees visit seven churches to pray, as part of their Holy Week devotions. Many also participate in the <strong>Passion of Christ readings</strong>, in which the life and death of Jesus are read aloud, allowing the faithful to meditate on His suffering. In some regions, <strong>penitents</strong> engage in acts of penance, including self-flagellation and even crucifixion reenactments, reflecting the intense devotion of the Filipino people during this period.</p>
    
    <p>In the Philippines, Good Friday is also a time of quiet reflection. Shops, malls, and public transportation are typically closed, creating a peaceful atmosphere across the nation. The day is a moment for Filipinos to focus on the significance of Christ's sacrifice, leading into the joyful celebration of His resurrection on Easter Sunday.</p>
